# C++
----------
This repository contains three important folders, which are
- sections
- homework
- algorithms

Their names could be to suggest the type of content that anyone can find inside of them, but I am going to explain briefly each folder.

## Sections
-------
[sections](sections/)

All source files, headers, and definitions are notes that I took (coded) when I was enrolled in a C++ course. That is the reason that you could see many comments even commented code (I know that is a really bad practice) in them. These files include basic and intermedium topics, such as
- Conditional Statements.
- Primitive variables.
- Arrays
- Loops
- Functions & methods
- Enums
- Pass reference
- Pointers
- Memory
- Header Files
- Structs
- Classes
- Operator overloading
- Friend Class
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstrac class
- Template functions and classes
- Namespace
- Files

## Homework
---------------
[homework](homework/)
All source files are the solutions that I implemented for exercises of each section of C++ course.  The topics are the same as the "sections" folder.

## Algorithms
-----------
[algorithms](algorithms/)
When I finished the C++ course. I wanted to try my knowledge by doing some basic algorithms. The result was the implementation of...

- Linked list
- Double linked list
- Queue 
- Stack 
- BinaryTreeSeach
